      In 1572, a star with the brightness of Venus appeared in the
      constellation of Cassiopeia. A second one followed in Ophiuchus in 1604.
      Both faded away within a few months of being seen, seemingly restoring
      Heaven to its eternally unchanging state...

      ...but change had been sparked on Earth, where the new stars had caught
      the attention of the astronomers Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler. They
      recorded their observations for posterity in the form of two books,
      titled *De nova et nullius aevi memoria prius visa stella* and *De Stella
      nova in pede Serpentarii*. Three centuries after Cassiopeia changed, the
      scientists who followed in their footsteps began to grasp the true nature
      of a "new star" and the frightening power that it unleashed.
