- name: Stella Nova
  desc: |
    In 1572, a star with the brightness of Venus appeared for a few months in
    the constellation of Cassiopeia. A second one followed in Ophiuchus in
    1604.

    The title of this piece is from *De nova et nullius aevi memoria prius visa
    stella* and *De Stella nova in pede Serpentarii*, in which Tycho Brahe and
    Johannes Kepler used their observations of these "new stars" to lay to rest
    the illusion of an eternally unchanging celestial sphere. Three centuries
    onward, their work helped us begin to understand what really makes the
    stars shine.

    Have you ever watched a thistle seed drift across a sunny field? Or tried
    to follow one?
